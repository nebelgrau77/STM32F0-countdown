# STM32F0-countdown

First step towards a "quiet timer" that uses a LED instead of a buzzer to tell you the time is up
(useful in contexts where you shouldn't distract others, e.g. for an examiner keeping track of time 
students take to do the exercise). 

Improvements needed:

- time keeping with timers/interrupts
- countdown setup with a potentiometer/ADC
- button to stop/reset the count
